  abstract = {We present the Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) method and its implementation
	in Quickstep which is part of the freely available program package
	CP2K. The \{GPW\} method allows for accurate density functional calculations
	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the \{GPW\} energy
	functional, namely ionic forces and the KohnâSham matrix, can be
	computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing
	the total energy and the KohnâSham matrix is scaling linearly with
	the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens
	of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large
	Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate
	the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed
	phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules
	and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving BornâOppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations
	using commodity \{PCs\} as well as supercomputers. },

	and the use of shell models, incorporating two new methods of fitting.
	Concurrent fitting of multiple structures is found to enhance greatly
	the reliability of the derived potentials and can lead to a physically
	sensible O-O potential without the use of constraints. Inclusion
	of gas-phase cluster information appears to be beneficial even within
	an ionic model. By combining free-energy minimization with empirical
	fitting based on displacements, rather than gradients, it is now
	possible to determine interatomic potentials with correct treatment
	of thermal effects and the zero-point energy. },

	consider the ideal zeolite to be an assembly of rigid corner-sharing
	perfect tetrahedra. The corner linkages between tetrahedra are hard-sphere
	oxygen atoms{,} which are presumed to act as freely-rotating{,} force-free{,}
	spherical joints. All other inter-tetrahedral forces{,} such as coulomb
	interactions{,} are ignored. Thus{,} the flexibility window represents
	the null-space of the kinematic matrix that governs the allowable
	internal motions of the ideal zeolite framework. We show that almost
	all of the known aluminosilicate or aluminophosphate zeolites exhibit
	a flexibility window. Consequently{,} the presence of flexibility
	in a hypothetical framework topology promises to be a valuable indicator
	of synthetic feasibility. We describe computational methods for exploring
	the flexibility window{,} and discuss some of the exceptions to this

  abstract = { The formulation of the classical barrier-crossing problem is reviewed
	in the context of numerical simulations, with the focus on barrier
	crossing problems where the reaction coordinate depends in a non-trivial
	way on the Cartesian coordinates of many particles. Often it is convenient
	to measure the barrier height using constrained dynamics. Such a
	calculation requires a knowledge of the Jacobian for the coordinate
	transformation between Cartesian and generalized (âreactionâ) coordinates,
	and it is shown that the calculation of this Jacobian can be simplified.
	The conventional expression for the crossing rate is found to become
	computationally inefficient when the barrier crossing is diffusive.
	An alternative formulation of the barrier-crossing rate is given
	that leads to much better statistical accuracy in the computed crossing
	rates. },
